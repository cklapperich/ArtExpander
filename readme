Use TWO art expansions at once!

have custom artwork for 1st edition or Full Art cards! and more!

This mod allows for UNIQUE destiny artwork, plus unique artwork for EVERY border type: 
	Base,
	FirstEdition,
	Silver,
	Gold,
	EX,
	FullArt

It also allows custom artwork for Destiny Cards separate from base cards. 

How to structure your artwork:
Destiny/Base/PiggyA.png
Destiny/Gold/PiggyA.png
Destiny/PiggyA.png
all_expansions/Silver/PiggyA.png
all_expansions/PiggyA.png

The final example works but should be avoided: use a texture replacer instead for optimal performance here. The rest are fine.

Any files not found will default to the texture replacer, then to the base game.

Please name folders correctly.

Only use this mod to:
* Add border-specific artwork
* Add artwork that applies to all destiny cards of a certain monster

The game will load all of its own images first, then the images from ArtExpander after.
