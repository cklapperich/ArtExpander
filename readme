USING ASSET BUNDLES:

Install Unity, then make a  new Unity 2021.3.38 project.

1. Prepare Your Files:
   - Put all your PNG files in your Unity project's Assets folder
   - Organize them in folders matching the structure:
     ```
     animated/
         MonsterType_black/
             0.png
             1.png
             2.png
             etc...
         MonsterType_white/
             0.png
             1.png
             2.png
             etc...
     ```

2. Mark Files for Bundle:
   - In Unity's Project window, select ALL the PNG files you want to include
   - In the Inspector panel at the bottom, find "Asset Bundle"
   - Click the dropdown menu
   - Select "New"
   - Name it exactly "animated"

3. Build the Bundle:
   - Open Window → Asset Management → Asset Bundle Browser
   - If you don't see this option:
     - Open Window → Package Manager
     - Click "+" in top left
     - Choose "Add package by name"
     - Type: "com.unity.assetbundlebrowser"
     - Click "Add"
   - In the Bundle Browser:
     - Go to "Build" tab
     - Set "Output Path" to anywhere convenient
     - UNCHECK "Copy to StreamingAssets"
     - Click "Build"

4. After Building:
   - Find the built file named "animated"
   - Copy it to your mod's folder structure at "cardart/Ghost/animated.assets"
   - DON'T copy the .manifest files - you only need the main bundle file

This will create a single asset bundle containing all your PNG files, maintaining their folder structure for proper loading in your mod.
